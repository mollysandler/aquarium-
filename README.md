final project for CPE 203 at cal poly

My first time using Java on a large scale project.
Some of this code is original, some of it is converted from procedural programming to OOP.
Each entity in the world implements A* pathfinding to access its next target.
When you click a square on the screen, a barrel of toxic sludge appears, and spills its sludge onto the surrounding squares.
When an octopi goes adjacent to one of the sludge squares, it becomes "mutant" and changes its apperance and movement.
Shrimp are spawned from the barrel and go off into the world as well.
